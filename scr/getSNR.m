function [snr, ppAmp, noiseLev] = getsnr(x, y, noiseRange, mode)
% getsnr    Calculate signal to noise ratio, defined as the ratio between
% peak to peak intensity of the signal over the standard deviation of the 
% noise distribution. The peak to peak amplitude of the signal is 
% calculated over all the spectrum, while the standard deviation of the 
% noise is calculated only in the noiseRange region.

% [snr, ppAmp, noiseLev] = getSNR(x, y, noiseRange, Mode)
% Input:
%   x           vector of length N
%   y           spectrum, vector of length N
%   noiseRange  segments of the spectrum considered as noise (expressed
%               in the units of x),
%               double (Mx2): [x11 x12; x21 x22; ...]
%   mode        determines how the NoiseLev is calculated, Stdev (default)
%               or PeaktoPeak
